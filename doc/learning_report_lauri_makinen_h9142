Objective


My objective was to make educational medicine game with project team. I also opted to be on management side of the project and was very pleased to get that on my shoulders. We built an application with intuitive ui and high availability accross different screen sizes.
I am aiming for excellent grade.

Background/previous understanding of the subject 

I have not been part of project organisation so process of project was mostly new to me. Also Focus tool chain had components new to me (circleci, heroku, doorbell.io) so also new technologies  were present on this project. As a coding languege php was unfamiliar before this years serverprogramming course. CakePHP and MVC model were new to me, but were an interesting challenge to work with.

Project assigment


Assigment was to make an educational game about medication to nursing student on different study levels. Our team consists of five members where two members had main responsibility on coding and rest had responsibilities on documenting, designing and other project related general things.

Fundamental learning


I learned a lot about project working and how to document this work from start to finish. I also learned about CakePHP platform and importance of the ci driven develompent.

Conclusive


Goals that were set were met. The game works as intented and is well documented.
Most of the problems came when trying to fit all peaces of this project together when planning and working with all these platforms and technologies when implementing.
In the future I am going to try to make work of team members more efficient by managing with more refined mindset about how project is supposed to curve from start to finnish. I'm also going to improve my coding and documentation skills.
As a grade I suggest 5 because I managed the project with consistent effort and looked after our sprint and waypoint related goals and also prepared all meetings with client and customers beforehand.
