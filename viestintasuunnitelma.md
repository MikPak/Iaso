This document is an example of a project's plan, in a wiki-like form.


#	Introduction

The purpose of this plan is to define the programs, applications and channels used for communication while working on project X. Clear and efficient ways of communication ensure that the information moves smoothly from a person to another and that the project's quality is up to the pre-defined standards. .

In this document, we create the foundations for the communication between the project team and three other parties. 

#	General channels for communication

The team's ways of communication consist of telephone, e-mail, mail, www, slack and other literary / verbal ways of communication.
# Literary communication
The literary communication about / for the project consists mainly of JAMK's official reporting model.
#	Inner communication

Inner communication is the communication between the members of the group. It's main goal is to relay information about the project from one person to the others in the group, therefore improving the group's co-operation and helping in forming the identity of the group. The inner communication is also the base of all outgoing communication.
The group gathers on [monday mornings <INSERT WEEKDAY HERE>] for a meeting in which they go through the plans for the week, and review the earlier week's works. [The project manager readies the meeting's list of contents, and writes a schedule for the week. The schedule will be posted in the LN-database and for the members of the group.]  All documentation for the project will be stored in the [Document database], which the members should actively keep up with and follow. The assigned secretary informs the group members of all noteworthy events via email or messages, and writes the events down. 
Both the inner and general communication will be supported by the use of :
-	[LN-application], in which all information with contacts will be stored in. (ie. a phone conversation with the client).  
-	[Application A, with which the emails coming in to the groups LN-email will be relayed forward to the group's members' personal e-mails.]

#	Communication with the instructors.

The goal in the communication between the group and the instructors is to grant the instructors a clear and smooth way to supervise the project, and to give them the resources to help the project to advance. The main channel of communication will be the [LN document database] and [<weekday>] meetings with the director [hh]:n kanssa. The secretary readies the notes for the meeting and writes them down. In addition to the above mentioned ones, the most important channel of communication is [email], even though other ways will and can be used if necessary. The instructors will be notified of all notable events via one of the mentioned ways of communication.

#	Communication with the client's represetantives

The main way of communication between the group and the client's representatives are [meetings]. In addition to the previously mentioned, the primary way of communication will be  [email] and the secondary will be [phone]. The secretary provides the client's representatives with copies of all documents about the project via email.

#Communication with outsiders

Communication with people outside of the project depends on the consideration of the group members.  Some outsiders  (other projects, faculty staff) can be reached via [LN DATABASE]. Groups outside the project can follow the project via the project's www-page.


#	Supervising and reviewing the communication.

The project's communication will be supervised and reviewed continuously during the projects, for example in the meetings.  Possible shortcomings will be reviewed instantly and dealt with accordingly.
