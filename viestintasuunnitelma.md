##3	General channels for communication
The team’s ways of communication consist of telephone, e-mail, www, Trello, Slack and other literary/verbal ways of communication.

##4	Literary communication
The literary communication about/for the project consists of living wiki documentation in GitHub, time management on Gantt chart, task management on Trello board documentation models provided by the supervisors and in some rare cases JAMK’s official reporting model.

##5	Inner communication
Inner communication is the communication between the members of the group. Its main goal is to relay information about the project from one person to the others in the group, therefore improving the group's co-operation and helping in forming the identity of the group. The inner communication is also the base of all outgoing communication. The group gathers on Monday mornings for a meeting in which they go through the plans for the week, and review the last week's works. The project manager readies the meeting's list of contents, and writes a schedule for the week. The schedule will be posted in the Trello board.

##6	Communication with the instructors
The goal in the communication between the group and the instructors is to grant the instructors a clear and smooth way to supervise the project, and to give them the resources to help the project to advance. The main channel of communication will be the Trello board, Github wiki and meetings with the supervisors. The secretary readies the notes for the meeting and writes them down. In addition to the above mentioned ones, the most important channel of communication is email, even though other ways will and can be used if necessary. The instructors will be notified of all notable events via one of the mentioned ways of communication.

##7	Communication with the client's representatives
The main way of communication between the group and the client's representatives are meetings. In addition to the previously mentioned, the primary way of communication will be email and the secondary will be phone. The secretary provides the client's representatives with copies of all documents about the project via email.

##8	Communication with outsider
Communication with people outside of the project depends on the consideration of the group members. Some outsiders (other projects, faculty staff) can be reached via email. Groups outside the project can follow the project via the project's Github www-page.

##9	Supervising and reviewing the communication
The project's communication will be supervised and reviewed continuously during the projects, for example in the meetings. Possible shortcomings will be reviewed instantly and dealt with accordingly.
